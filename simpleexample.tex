\maketitle
This is where you would type stuff.

\section{The Pythagorean Section}
I'm going to write the Pythagorean Theorem in-line, like this $a^2+b^2=c^2$.

\subsection{The other subsection}
Then I'm going to write it as a standalone equation:
$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$

\subsubsection{where we do the subsubstuff}
QED.

% there are no subsubsubsections, those are called
\paragraph{does a paragraph need a curly brace?}

\subsubsection{another important subsection}\label{Sec:important}
\subsubsection*{yet another one}
\subsubsection{Is this 1.1.3 or 1.1.4?}

Previously, in subsection~\ref{Sec:important} we discussed the really important stuff.


In this section, we will include lists of stuff.

\begin{enumerate}
\item this is number 1
\item this is number 2
\item third thing
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item kind of the first thing
\item kind of the second thing
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Here's a nested thing.
\end{enumerate}
\item kind of the third thing \cite{HallEffect}
\end{itemize}

$$\beta_1^{x^2} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^N{\frac{a}{b}}$$

Really, you'd want to manage this with JabRef, mostly likely. It's free.
